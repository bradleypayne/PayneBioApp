I am a senior Math major at Pittsburg State University, and I am also pursuing a minor in computing. I also play football here at Pitt. Aside from football, I have may hobbies that include playing video games (Xbox mostly), playing almost any sport, watching movies, spending time with my siblings, and many more. I am the oldest of 10 children and I love every single one of those munchkins very much. I am so much older than them that sometimes it almost feels like I have raised my own kids. After graduting college I plan to pursue a masters degree in both Mathematics and Information Technology. After finishing school, I would like to work in software engineering or software development." />
